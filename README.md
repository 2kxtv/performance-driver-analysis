# Performance Drivers & Decision Impact Analysis

## Project Objective
This project focuses on diagnostic analytics to understand **why performance outcomes occur**, rather than only reporting what happened.

The analysis identifies key drivers behind SLA breaches and delays, enabling data-driven prioritisation and decision support.

## How This Fits With Project 1
- Project 1 answers: **What is happening?** (KPIs, trends)
- Project 2 answers: **Why is it happening and what should be done?** (drivers, risk, impact)

Together, they represent a full analytics maturity workflow.

## Tools Used
- PostgreSQL (pgAdmin) – analytical SQL
- Power BI – insight-focused visuals
- Excel – validation
- GitHub – version control and documentation

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Diagnostic and root-cause analysis
- Advanced SQL aggregation and segmentation
- Decision impact reasoning
- Stakeholder-focused insights
